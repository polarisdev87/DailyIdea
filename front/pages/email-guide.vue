          Every day, Daily Idea sends you an email to remind to submit an idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll store all your ideas for you so you can read them, update them,
          or add on to them later
        </p>
        <p>When we send you the email, you should just respond to the email.</p>
        <p>The first line of the email will become the title of your idea.</p>
        <p>The rest of the email will be details or a summary of your idea</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>An App for Renting Out Extra Rooms In You House For Money</p>
        <p>
          It'd be awesome if there was an app where I could post my extra
          bedroom and if people were visiting Chicago, they could rent it out.
          It could be cheaper than hotels so the visitors would benefir, and I
          would make a little extra money!
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, I could give them personalized local tips for exploring the
          city!
        </p>
        <p>Maybe I'll call it... Airbnb!</p>
